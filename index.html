      wedding about 2 years ago. As well as, I added in where I am located. I decided to use strong to

        <h2>Here's a little about me!</h2>
        <p>I've always been interested in programming. Whether that has been 
          game design, web design, or software design. I am more than eager 
          to find a career in the industry and work with many other designers!
